Lambda Simple:
	- in RAX in the end will be closure
	- (Slide 90): 
		* BLUE code is the code building the closure
		* ORANGE code is the BODY of the closure to run when applied
	- write ocaml code to generate assembley code of CreateExtEnv:
		- [calc |Env| - not necesarly in assem]
		- allocate ExtEnv - 1 + |Env|
		- copy pointers of minor vectors from Env (on stack) to 
		  ExtEnv with offset of one
		- Allocate ExtEnv[0] to point to a vector in the size of 			Params (as stored in the ArgsNum on stack)
		- copy parameters from the stack to that vector
