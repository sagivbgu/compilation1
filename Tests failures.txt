Tests failures

integer->char
    ASCII (<127) integers fails just because representation defferences ( #\x2  <-> #\x02 )
    Non-ASCII (>127) and "DEL" (=127) integers fail. Should ask in the forum.

make-string
    Unary varsion fails. But in this case chezscheme says the characters
    contained in the string are unspecified.
    So I guess we're fine. And, it might magically work after allowing stdlib functions

symbol->string
    Doesn't work with capital letters (our compiler converts them to lowercase)

rational?
    Fails but we're OK.
    From the assignment page:
    "Applying rational? to a floating-point value almost always returns #t in Chez,
    while our implementation returns #f for all floating point numbers."
